He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
Deep in the dark of the forest, lost and without any food.
"Anyone know where we are?" he asked.
Everyone scrambled for their smartphones.
Unfortunately with no reception, location based services would not work.
"Did anyone bring a map?" one of them asked.
"Nope. I figured my smartphone would work everywhere we went."
One person, opened the compass app on his smartphone.
However, with no latitude or longitude information, the compass was useless.
"I'm thirsty," said another.
"We have to figure out to get out of here before it is too late!" he said
Suddenly, the group heard a thundering crash in the trees.
Miranda screamed and started to freak out. She was getting cold and scared.
A figure emerged from the bush and started to run towards her! Miranda screamed "AAAHHHH"
Suddenly a growl came from behind Miranda, and Ankit's German Shepherd puppy darted out and started biting the ankle of the figure.
It quickly fled the scene leaving them all unnerved. Suddenly everyone went quiet.
It was odd...they were not startled by the attacker, but by the suffocating silence.
The air became very cool and damp.
Poison. Poison gas!
Nat faints.. Miranda screams yet again..
But the German Shepherd puppy dragged both Miranda and Nat away from the poisonous gas...
And then, in the glint of the moonlight, Steve spots a big red button that says:
 "DONT PUSH UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!!"
 "What should I do?" Steve asked.
"Push the button!" Mike yelled.
"Don't push it!" Ankit shouted.
Steve stared at the red button.
Pushing Steve out of the way, Mike slammed the button.
And out popped a big blue Genie, who sounded like Robin Williams, and granted the group one wish.
Except Robin Williams is dead... Who is it then?
It was who other than Yoda!! Warning everyone not to watch Star Wars Episode 7 The Force Awakens because it was an insult to George Lucas!!
